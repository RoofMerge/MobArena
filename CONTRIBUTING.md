Contributing
============
Here are the rules for contributing:

1. Use the allman style.
2. Ensure your formatting is good, we want our code to be clean :)
3. If you have too many commits, squash them into one please.
4. Test your changes.
5. Ensure there aren't any errors or warnings in your code, if there are warnings please ensure there won't be an NPE and use @SuppressWarnings to ensure the warning isn't showing up.
