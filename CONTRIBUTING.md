Contributing
============
Here are the rules for contributing:

1. Use the allman style.
2. Ensure your formatting is good, we want our code to be clean :)
3. If you have too many commits, squash them into one please.
4. Test your changes, and PLEASE ensure there aren't any errors in the code.
